# NuPhy Air 75 keyboard
1. Connect your device with the provided USB cable to the keyboard, which should be set to the wired mode, then go to VIA’s official online configurator at usevia.app with a Chromium-based browser.
2. Download the correct JSON file for your keyboard at NuPhy's website, the file can then be manually uploaded to the VIA configurator.
3. Click on the ‘SETTINGS’ tab(the gear icon in the top row of icons) to open the settings page. Toggle the ‘Show Design Tab’ switch on, the design tab icon(a brush) should then show up in the top row of icons.
4. Go to the design tab and drag the JSON file you have downloaded at Step 2 to the upload area at the top and upload it. Once the upload is successful, go to the ‘CONFIGURE’ tab again and click the ‘Authorize Device’ button, then select your device name in the pop-out window, an on-screen keyboard can be seen if the setup is successful.
