    git pull orgin master

## Branches
    git branch           # Show branches
    git branch issue53   # Create branch 'issue53'
    git checkout issue53 # Work with branch 'issue53'

Fix issue53 and commit the fix.
    git commit -am 'Fixed issue53'
    git push -u origin issue53 # Push to remote

Back to master branch
    git checkout master  # Switched to branch 'master'

Diff between branches
    git diff HEAD..origin/master [path]

Merge a branch
    git checkout master
    git merge issue53

Remove branch
    git branch --delete issue53        # Remove local branch
    git push origin --delete issue49   # Delete old (stale) branch on remote.

Get rid of remote branches that no longer exist on the remote
    git fetch --prune

## Stash

Stash (save current state) a working branch (issue54)
    git stash                  # Saved workingbranchi (issue54) with state WIP, use option -u for untracked files.
    git checkout issue53       # Work in otherbranch and commit you changes.
    git checkout issue54
    git stash pop              # Load previous work from branch issue54

## Tips

See recent changes of a specific file.
    git blame /path/to/file
    git reflog /path/to/file
    git log /path/to/file

Check with find

    find . -not -iwholename '*node_modules*' -not -iwholename '*.git*' -not -iwholename '*.sass-cache*' -ls

### Change name and email, remember password

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

## Show last commits

    git diff HEAD^..HEAD
    git difftool --tool=vimdiff


## Stage only deleted

    git ls-files --deleted -- lib/foo | xargs git add

## Git undo

To reset a specific file to the last-committed state (to discard uncommitted changes in a specific file):

    git checkout thefiletoreset.txt

To reset to last commit state. Run multiple times to go back further back in time.

    git reset HEAD~
    git status
    git checkout thefiletoreset.txt

Run `git reflog` to jump back and forwards in time, for example:

    get reset dfd69a56

Delete all files in the working copy (but not the .git/ folder!) which leaves it with only committed files.

    git reset --hard

Remove untracked files, including directories (-d) and files ignored by git (-x).
Replace the -f argument with -n to perform a dry-run and it will tell you what will be removed.

    git clean -d -x -n     # dry-run
    git clean -d -x -f

## Git revert vs. reset

When you git revert a commit, only the changes associated with that commit are undone.

## Ignoring files

    git rm --cached filename

    * [help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files)

## git delete - Mark as deleted files
Added the --no-run-if-empty option to xargs so that it doesn't throw an error when there are no deleted files:

    git ls-files -z -d | xargs -0 --no-run-if-empty git rm
    git commit -m 'delete files marked as deleted'

## git checkout delete files
If you have lots of files to restore you can use this which will re-checkout all the deleted files.

    git diff --name-status | sed -n '/^D/ s/^D\s*//gp' | xargs git checkout origin/master

## Submodules

Working on one project, you need to use another project from within it.

git submodule add -f https://github.com/google/vim-searchindex.git ~/gtd/dotfiles/.vim/pack/bundle/start/vim-searchindex
