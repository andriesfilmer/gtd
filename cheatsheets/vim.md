    :arg **/*.js                           " Set all *.js files and below current directory in :arg
    :argdo %s/pattern/replace/gce | update " Confirm updates in recursieve files

Option 2
    :vimgrep /pattern/ `find . -type f`" Set all files in quickfix list. Use `copen` to see the matches.
    :cdo %s/pattern/replace/gc         " Change all matches with a confirm.

## Sessions
    :mks                               " Save your session in current dir (default: `session.vim`)
    vim -S                             " Start with your saved session in current dir
    vim mks! .session-lang.vim         " Save session to `.session.lang.vim` file
    vim -S .session-lang.vim           " Start with your a session

    :changes                           " Show the list of changes
    3g;                                " Go 3 changes back

## Folding
    zc                                 " Fold current selection/syntax
    zo                                 " Open current fold
    zR                                 " Open all folds

## Macros

    qq                                 " Starts recording the macro 'q'
    q                                  " Stops recording the macro
    <num>@q                            " Repeat the macro <num> number of times

To save a macro: Use `qq` as normal, with the `qp` command you can paste the register into `.vimrc`.

    let @q = 'macro contents' "Be careful of quotes, though. They would have to be escaped properly.

Now you can use this macro in normal mode: @q

## ctags
    ctags -R *
    ctags -R --languages=ruby --exclude=.git --exclude=log . $(bundle list --paths)

Now you can jump from file to file:

    ctrl-]                             " Jump to class (in other file)
    ctrl-o                             " Jump Out (back)
    ctrl-i                             " Jump In (again)
    ctrl-t                             " Jump back to previous (?)

## Spell
    z=                                 " When on word show spelling.

## Numbering lines in a file
A neat filtering trick using the 'nl' for adding linenumbers.

    :%! nl -ba                           " Whole file
    :'<,'>! nl -ba                       " Visual selection

## Tabs and Spaces

1 - Convert tabs to spaces
