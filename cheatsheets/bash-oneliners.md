# Bash oneliners

Nice resource: <https://www.commandlinefu.com/>

## Kill many processes

One's I started hylafax with deamontools and it started many procceses. `killall hfaxd` did't work.

To kill all processes use the command

    ps -acx | grep hfaxd | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill

## Remove many file in a directorie

When there are many thousand of files in a directory you can't remove them with 'rm *'. But the next command can.

    cd directorie; for f in * ; do rm -rf $f ; done

### Zip a file and emails them to someone

    gzip -c FILENAME |uuencode FILENAME.gz | mail -s "SUBJECT" someone@domain.nl

## Testing the load/response on a website

    for i in `jot 5000` ; do wget --save-headers http://www.filmer.nl/ ; done

## Find commands

Find permissons on files and directories

    find /path/to/dir/ -perm -0777 -type d
    find /path/to/dir/ -not -perm 400
    find /path/to/dir/ -not -group sudo

Changing Permissions Recursively.

    find /path/to/dir/ -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    find /path/to/dir/ -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    find /path/to/dir/ -exec chown www-data:www-data {} \;

Find empy directories

    find . -type d -empty

Find large files

    find /path/to/ -type f -size +100M

Find recently modified files

    find /path/to/file -newer notes.txt
    find /path/to/dir/ -amin -30

Find with regular expression (files whose names start with the letter w)

    find /path/to/dir/ -regex "./w.*"

### Find mixings

Delete files using xargs:

    find . -name "*.old" -print0 | xargs -0 rm

Find and sort result by file sizes

    ls -lSR | sort -k 5 -n

Find files between dates (and times)

    find public/uploads/sites/ -type f -newermt "2023-03-01 10:17:00" ! -newermt "2023-04-02 10:53:00"

Find files older than -x (-1) days created and show this with date and time

    find /path/to/dir/ -type f -ctime -1 -ls | awk '{print $8 "" $9 "" $10 "" $11 " (" $7 ")" }'

Find files for a certain word or phrase within the files:

    find . -type f -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 grep -r -i 'some.*thing'

Find files with 'sometext' who are not in de Sent Items map.

    find /path/to/dir/ -type f ! -regex '.*/.Sent*.*' -print0 | xargs -0 grep -r -i 'sometext'

Find and remove files older then 3 days

    find /path/to/dir/ -type f ! -atime -3d -print0 | xargs -0 rm

Find all media outside 'Photo Library' directory

    find /path/to/media -name '*Photo Library*' -prune -o -iregex ".*(jpg|dv|avi|mp3)$" | less

Change all the ruby-files with the content 'someString' to 'some_string'

    find /path/to/dir/ -name "*.rb" | xargs perl -pi -e 's/someString/some_string/g'


## Rename files

Rename files and replace spaces to hivens.

    for file in *.jpg; do mv "$file" "$(echo "$file" | sed 's/ /-/g')"; done

Fix some files (matching 1.png, 2.png, ... 9.png) so that they have leading zeros for proper ordering.

    for i in [1-9].png ; do mv $i 0$i ; done

If you have many files in your directory and you want to rename them with numbering.

    i=1;for f in Picture*.png ;do mv "$f" "Picture_$i.png" ;((i++));done

Rename files recursive

    find path/to/many/dirs/ -iname "*css.scss*" | sed -e "p;s/.css.scss/.scss/" | xargs -n2 mv


Heres how to add a t_ to all the .jpg files in the current directory:
(Remember to remove the "echo" if you like the results.)

    for i in *jpg ;do echo mv -i -- "./$i" "./t_${i}" ;done

If that looks good.. then remove the "echo" to make the changes permanent. <br>
(Remember to remove the first "echo" if you like the results.)

Change all the .JPG files to .jpg<br>
(Remember to remove the "echo" if you like the results.)

    for i in *JPG ;do j="`echo ./$i |sed 's/JPG$/jpg/'`" ;mv -i -- "./$i" "./$j" ;done


Rename spaces in filenames to _ <br>
Example: pretty girl.jpg to pretty_girl.jpg<br>
(Remember to remove the "echo" if you like the results.)

    for i in ** ;do j="`echo ./$i |sed 's/JPG$/jpg/'`" ;mv -i -- "./$i" "./$j" ;done

Remove files with strange names like '?????OA??'

Solution: Remove file by an inode number.  The -i option to ls displays the index number (inode) of each file:

    ls -li

Use find command as follows to delete the file if the file has inode number 4063242:

    find . -inum 4063242 -delete

## diff

Difference between two file directories (side-by-side)

    diff -y <(tree app/assets/stylesheets/sites/dosc/) <(tree app/assets/stylesheets/sites/skell/)

## Mix

Manupulate numbers

Make the phone/faxnumbers unique and remove 06,084 and 087 numbers Also remove the DOS returns (^M)

    sort -u numbers.txt | sed '/^06/d' | sed '/^084/d' | sed '/^087/d' | tr -d '' > numbers2.txt

Randomize the numbers from a text file.

    perl -e 'print map {$_->[1]} sort {$a->[0]<=>$b->[0]} map {[rand,$_]} <>' numbers2.txt > numbers3.txt

SSH copy public key

    cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh you@other-host 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
